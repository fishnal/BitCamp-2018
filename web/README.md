# Organization

## Process

1. Use a cookie to store the current state of the client (that lives for 5 minutes because user should not take more than 5 minutes to authorize); state is randomly generated every 5 minutes
2. Authorization is opened from client-side (triggered from some event like a button), with a state passed through.
3. After authorization and redirection takes place, the state is then verified to make sure it hasn't changed; it can change or be different than what the cookie says based on two conditions:
	+ User takes longer than 5 minutes to authorize
	+ User attempts to go to post-auth redirection page without actually authorizing
4. `code` query parameter returned in redirection URL is sent to backend
5. Backend retrieves an access token, sends all relevant data back
6. Perform any Spotify API calls necessary.

## Files

+ `server.js` is backend server code, used to retrieve an access token and handle any Spotify API calls
+ `client.js` is frontend server code, used to redirect to authorization and handle client side interactions
+ `*.html` is frontend HTML code, likely to change
